# Sokoban Project

## Presentation

This project is my first project in Python. It has been realized during my second year of IT studies at the UBO.

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the Sokoban game. The game is implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the GUI. The game has a simple GUI that allows the player to move the player character using the arrow keys. The player can also restart the game. The player can choose between different levels of difficulty (101 levels). The game has a simple scoring system that keeps the highest level reached by the player.

## Installation

To install the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

You also need to have the tkinter library installed. You can install the tkinter library by running the following command:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Usage

To run the game, you need to run the `sokoban.py` file. You can run the file by running the following command:

```bash
python3 sokoban.py
```

## Issues

If you encounter any issues while running the game, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maskady/Sokoban/issues).
